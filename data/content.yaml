experience:
  - title: Senior Test Development Engineer
    company: WHOOP
    location: Boston, MA
    period: July 2022 - Present
    highlights:
      - Architected and maintained a Python-based factory test platform supporting 20 automated stations across four production lines, enabling daily throughput in the thousands and lifetime production in the millions.
      - Led Gen 4 to Gen 5 factory test evolution, improving first-pass yield from ~95% to ~99% through tighter sensor validation, calibration routines, and failure classification.
      - Designed and validated ECG test fixtures and contributed to all major fixture designs spanning board-level test, system functional test, firmware update, and burn-in stations.
      - Implemented production-grade software controls including mandatory unit and simulation testing, test report generation, and software hash validation to prevent unverified code from reaching manufacturing.
      - Owned the factory software release pipeline, integrating GitHub Actions for automated testing, build, and deployment while coordinating internal sign-off and Arena-controlled external releases.

  - title: Product Industrialization Test Engineer
    company: Philips
    location: Cambridge, MA
    period: June 2021 - July 2022
    highlights:
      - Re-architected legacy LabVIEW-based test report parsing by rewriting in C#, reducing runtime by over 80%
      - Managed critical test network software by writing and scheduling SQL database sorting using PowerShell scripts to speed up global share-drive data collection
      - Supported emergency CAPA effort using Python and Minitab to analyze over 2,000 production units
