  bio: Senior manufacturing software test engineer with 4.5 years supporting high-volume wearable production. I architect Python-based factory test platforms that increased yield from 95% to 99% while reducing cycle time by 75%. I bring production-grade software practices to hardware testing, implementing automated releases, CI/CD pipelines, and rigorous validation that prevents unverified code from reaching manufacturing.
